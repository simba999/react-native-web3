# devery app

A personal project for learning react-native and react-navigation. Built with CRNA.
Basic implementation of screens from set-1 of [invisionpp DO UI kit](https://www.invisionapp.com/do).

Currently focused on getting the UI to look the same first. So most things should look ok but are not really functional.

## Prerequisites
* Node (version 8.0.0 later)
* yarn
* android emulator or device with expo (24 or later)

## Running
This is built with CRNA without any extra native components. Runs on expo v24 or later.
```
### clone the repo and cd into the directory, then

$ yarn install
$ yarn start

### run the app in expo
```
